# Stream

**Work in Progress**

This project is a web application for streaming and watching videos, based on my previous project, "Streaming".  

Compared to the previous version, this system aims to provide better scalability thanks to the usage of Kubernetes and support a wider range of programming languages.  

- Frontend: Angular  
- Backend: Multiple languages (currently Java Spring Boot and Kotlin Ktor)  

To simplify deployment with kubernetes, a ui is being developed with:  
- Frontend: React  
- Backend: Go
